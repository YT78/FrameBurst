# FrameBurst
This Java based Android app is a port of my old IOS app that I made in XCode/Swift. It is a fighting game companion app that displays character profiles, wiki links for specific characters, and videos displaying super moves previously uploaded to my YouTube channel for characters from Blazblue and Guilty Gear and expands on it with added move lists with included frame data, and it also includes more fighting game series. The frame data and move lists will be implemented with data provided by dustloop, a website known for providing constant updates to character data for anime fighting games primarily developed and published by Arc System Works, such as Blazblue, Guilty Gear, Under Night, and Persona 4 Arena. The frame data is implemented in such a way that it will update within the app whenever the data is updated on dustloop's site. It's great to use this app instead of constantly having to look online for character data when playing fighting games and/or when you're in the middle of a match. Always nice to have a companion app when playing a game, no matter what game it is.
